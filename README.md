This dashboard is designed to compare year-to-date (YTD) sales with the previous year-to-date (PYTD) figures.
### Project purpose:
          To provide a comprehensive overview of Plant Co.'s sales performance by comparing current year-to-date (YTD) sales with the previous year-to-date (PYTD) figures, 
          enabling analysis of sales trends across different dimensions (country, product, month) and identification of key drivers impacting overall performance, particularly the significant decrease in YTD sales
### Project Goals:
          1.See how sales are doing this year compared to last year. (YTD vs PYTD)
          2.Find out why sales are going up or down. (Drivers of change)
          3.See how different countries are doing in sales. (Geographic performance)
          4.Track sales month by month. (Monthly trends)
          5.See which products are selling well. (Product performance)
          6.Figure out which customers are most profitable. (Account profitability)
          7.Use this information to make better business decisions. (Data-driven decisions)
### Key Findings:
         1. Significant Sales Decline: The most prominent finding is a substantial decrease in year-to-date (YTD) sales compared to the previous year-to-date (PYTD), with a difference of -13.65M. This indicates a major downturn in sales performance
         2.Country-Specific Performance: The breakdown by country reveals how each region contributed to the overall decline. Some countries might have performed better or worse than others, providing insights into regional market dynamics
         3.Monthly Sales Fluctuations: The monthly analysis shows how sales varied throughout the year compared to the previous year. This highlights specific months that experienced significant gains or losses, potentially due to seasonality, marketing efforts, or other factors
         4.Product Category Impact: The categorization by product type (Indoor, Landscape, Outdoor) reveals how each category performed and contributed to the overall sales trend. This can help identify which product lines are driving the decline or showing resilience
         5.Profitability vs. Sales Volume: The scatter plot shows the relationship between profitability (GP%) and sales volume. This helps identify accounts that are both highly profitable and generate significant revenue, as well as those that might require different strategies
### Tools and Technologies:
